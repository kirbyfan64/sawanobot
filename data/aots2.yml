      lyrics: |+
        Wouldn't it be nice to take a walk on some pure white sand,
        Gaze at the horizon,
        Without living in fear ?
        Wouldn't be sweet to watch the sun curve down meets the waves?
        And taste the ocean spray
        And realize we'd been living as slaves

        We've got to learn to
        Get back, get back
        But is it worth the price of our soul ?
        You know you had to
        Kill her, kill her!
        Oh my dirty hands
        It never fades
        And if we
        Get out, get out
        I'll think about the price of our soul
        We've got to learn to
        Live free, live free
        We'll live a life without barricades

        How long I haven't seen the light
        Shine through in my life
        Lost everything,
        Family, confusion on the way
        Someone tries to talk to me
        And signpost the righteous road,
        My animal inside
        Can now be tamed to go
        Over the wall

        We've got to learn to
        Get back, get back
        But is it worth the price of our soul ?
        You know you had to
        Kill her, kill her!
        Oh my dirty hands
        It never fades
        And if we
        Get out, get out
        I'll think about the price of our soul
        We've got to learn to
        Live free, live free
        We'll live a life without barricades

        We've got to learn to
        Get back, get back
        But is it worth the price of our soul ?
        You know you had to
        Kill her, kill her!
        Oh my dirty hands
        It never fades
        And if we
        Get out, get out
        I'll think about the price of our soul
        We've got to learn to
        Live free, live free
        We'll live a life without barricades

      lyrics: |+
        Alles Lebendige stirbt eines Tages
        Ob wir zum Sterben bereit sind oder nicht
        Der Tag kommt sicher

        Ist das der Engel, der vom dämmernden Himmel hinunter flog?
        Ist das der Teufel, der aus der Felsenspalte heraus kroch?

        Tränen, Ärger, Mitleid, Grausamkeit
        Frieden, Chaos, Glaube, Verrat
        Wir werden gegen unser Schicksal ankämpfen
        Wir dürfen uns nicht in unser Schicksal ergeben

        Mit Trauer und Entscheidung im Herzen
        Zeigen wir den Willen weiterzugehen
        Niemand darf eigensinnig seines Lebens beraubt werden

        Mit Trauer und Entscheidung im Herzen
        Zeigen wir den Willen weiterzugehen
        Niemand darf eigensinnig seines Lebens beraubt werden

      lyrics: |+
        Don't you think of me enough?
        I've been burning my heart out
        Got to face, need to salute
        I will run 'cause I'm already saved

        You will know you're reborn tonight
        Must be alright, but I stay by your side
        Even if my body breaks to the bones
        I don't want to go through that ever again

        So cry no more, oh my beloved
        Go ahead, be proud and finally live
        You are the ONE, a rising star
        You've got a spark to hold. You're a god.

      lyrics: |+
        Look over there
        That one big hole
        Somebody's got to move this huge stone
        A dog? A hound?
        I hear the sound
        It is a half mile away from home

        What was everything you were fighting for?
        The sun in the sky it makes me so blue
        Rotten everything that I liked you for
        You can't give up!

        Now you see
        Chasing the light
        It's blowing right through the air
        We gonna keep on fighting for our dreams
        Come on! We'll get on all fours
        And then we will crawl in the grass
        Until lost in my mind
        I am just losing myself

        I try to care
        They look so young
        And left there toys and picked up a gun
        They kiss goodbye a lullaby
        I have to train them
        All in bloody war

        What was everything you were fighting for?
        The sun in the sky it makes me so blue
        Rotten everything that I liked you for
        You can't give up!

        Now you see
        Chasing the light
        It's blowing right through the air
        We gonna keep on fighting for our dreams
        Come on! We'll get on all fours
        And then we will crawl in the grass
        Until lost in my mind
        I am just losing myself

        Now you see
        Chasing the light
        It's blowing right through the air
        We gonna keep on fighting for our dreams
        Come on! We'll get on all fours
        And then we will crawl in the grass
        Until lost in my mind
        I am just losing myself

        Now you see
        Chasing the light
        It's blowing right through the air
        We gonna keep on fighting for our dreams
        Come on! We'll get on all fours
        And then we will crawl in the grass
        Until lost in my mind
        I am just losing myself

        I heard all the bells calling
        Our nightmares of walls falling
        You came back and gave your help
        But you're lying on the ground
        We turn back the tide of hell
        And win back our fantasy
        We fight for our right to be a free people again

        And now we can see people shouting everywhere
        So much blood shed I can't bear
        I can not erase the words you said to me
        But now you're dead
        You will stand the endless rain
        Wish I could have helped you more
        When you died only the day before

      lyrics: |+
        Die Stühle liegen sehr eng
        Wir reden die ganze Nacht lang
        Dieser niedrige Raum ist nicht schlecht
        Wir können uns gut verstehen

        So ist es immer, unser Licht ist nur das
        Trinken und singen wir, begrüßen morgen
        So ist es immer, unterm riesigen Himmel
        Leben wir zusammen, die Nacht ist lang

        Da die Sterne nicht leuchten
        Kann der Mond auf diese Stadt nicht scheinen
        Schauten wir das Licht selbst an
        Singen wir unter dem Sternenmeer

        Chairs so close and room so small
        You and I talk all the night long
        Meagre this space but serves us so well
        We comrades have stories to tell

        And it's always like that in the evening time
        We drink and we sing when our fighting is done
        And it's always so we live under the burnt clouds
        Ease our burden, long is the night

        Just as no stars can be seen
        We are stars and we'll beam on our town
        We must all gather as one
        Sing with hope and the fear will be gone

        Die Stühle liegen sehr eng
        You and I talk all the night long
        Dieser niedrige Raum ist nicht schlecht
        We comrades have stories to tell

        So ist es immer, denn immer im Ertrag
        We drink and we sing when our fighting is done
        So ist es immer, we live under the burnt clouds
        Ease our burden, long is the night

        Da die Sterne nicht leuchten
        We are stars and we'll beam on our town
        Schauten wir das Licht selbst an
        Sing with hope and the fear will be gone

        See it on the people's faces everyewhere
        Black'n'blue but they won't throw the towel in
        And let go of a dream
        Man, women, child prepare to bleed

        Were we born to lose and let goliath win?
        Heavy air and screaming as you pull the pin
        Our world is collapsing but we can rebuild it
        A 100 more years in the fire

        Do you believe that we can just kill them all?
        Do you believe that we can conquer this?
        Can't delete all the mess that I have seen
        Fall in the fire but these burns will heal you

        Gonna take your knives and skills they must be honed
        Show your mom your lives and give a dog a bone
        Just wait for centuries
        Man, women, child long to be free

        When we die we ask our brothers one more time
        If the meaning of our lives was worth a dime
        Our world oxidizes but will surprise us
        A 100 more years in the fire

        Do you belive that we can just kill them all?
        Do you believe that we can conquer this?
        Can't delete all the mess that I have seen
        Fall in the fire but these burns will heal you

        Coming down to show you what to do
        How to die with honor, dignity
        We should delete all the mess out from our sight
        What is truth is for me and you?

        Do you belive that we can just kill them all?
        Do you believe that we can conquer this?
        Can't delete all the mess that I have seen
        Fall in the fire but these burns will heal you

        Coming down to show you what to do
        How to die with honor, dignity
        We should delete all the mess out from our sight
        What is truth is for me and you?
