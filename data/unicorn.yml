      lyrics: |+
        All my friends have gone away
        I need myself to sing this song
        But you always passed away
        But It seems to be o.k.
        All my wish and powers
        They would take me to the gate
        Should I really find my problem?
        Do I really want to know about?
        I'm writing a letter for me
        Is there anything I would say?

        I don't have to throw my life away
        Everything goes wrong to turn into the way of life
        This could take so long to find the way
        All those people cry in vain
        Now I see the light in pain
        I can find the way of love

        You don't have to throw your life away
        Everything goes wrong to turn into the way of life
        This could take so long to find the way
        All those people cry in vain
        Now you can see the light in pain

        Say good bye into the perfect sky
        But it's your love can be the real life line
